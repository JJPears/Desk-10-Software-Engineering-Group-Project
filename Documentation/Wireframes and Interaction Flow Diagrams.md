<h1 align="center">Wireframes and Interaction Flow Diagrams</h1>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the initial wireframe had been created, it was distributed to a small number of users (mainly students at the University of Bristol) for a design and functionality review. The feedback was generally very positive. However because of this, could be deemed as biased since it all came from friends of the team members, who were likely to give a biased positive response. In our evaluation and reflection, the team decided if more time or resources were available, it would have been more informative to distribute the wireframe to a wider demographic, who would have potentially been more critical and provided more informative feedback. Furthermore, since the design has evolved so much since the initial wireframe, it would be a good idea to distribute the updated design to users for more relevant feedback. If the team has time before submission, this will be done so that the design can be improved if there is time, or at least some more user feedback can be considered in the evaluation or as potential ideas discussed in the Future Work section of the documentation.</p>

We have designed an interaction flow diagram using Figma, ensuring that we remain consistent with the wireframe we have also produced.
