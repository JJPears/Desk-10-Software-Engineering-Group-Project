<h1 align="center">Design Evaluation</h1>

### Details of how we evaluated our designs. Description of techniques suitable for our particular design. A timeline of evaluation of our design.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The design process began shortly after the project proposal had been confirmed in late February. As a team, we decided to individually draft design ideas and shared them back in a Microsoft Teams meeting. Due to the remote nature of this work, it proved unrealistic to effectively combine our ideas into one definitive prototype. To address the limitations of remote working, we decided to use a collaborative design tool called Figma. The use of Figma made the design process much smoother and manageable as we were able to illustrate, discuss and make decisions in real-time. Since its implementation, the team's developers could continuously present and refine prototypes into a singular finalised wireframe.</p>

The original wireframe prototype has significant differences in design from the final product. This is mainly due to our decision to base the final design on an Angular template. Other factors include the front end team exploring and discovering which elements of the design process was feasible in terms of resources available.We also took into account user feedback from our wireframe testing. Despite these design changes, the functionality of the application has, for the most part, remained consistent since the start of the project. To accommodate for changes on the way, an updated wireframe was later created as a reference for front end code development and as a means to accumulate user feedback information.

As discussed in the 'Front End' section of the documentation, the decision to use a template from the Argon website (https://demos.creative-tim.com/argon-design-system-angular) came in early March, when the team mutually agreed that it would save time and provide us with the tools needed to achieve the aesthetic look we envisioned. While it was initially confusing trying to work out the function of every file within the template, after many hours of trial and error, the pieces began to fall in place. The front end team were now able to begin implementing desired features within the HTML, stylesheet and typescript files of the template. Many ideas of what the site would look like evolved other the course of the coding as expectations were managed with the reality of the teams' limited software development skills/experience and the relatively short timeframe in which we had to complete this project. An example of this was removing the option to upload and view more than one profile picture due to complications arising in both the front and back end development.

Throughout the progression of the coded design implementation, HTML, CSS, SCSS and typescript files were used to edit and create components. By utilising the pre-made SCSS styling configurations in HTML classes, we were able to keep the final design simple, consistent and visually appealing whilst ensuring a pleasant user experience.
