<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a team, our project management initially focused on splitting the responsibilities of the team in two, with Jai and Josh focusing on the backend and the others on the frontend, specifically on getting the front end layout, a backend schema and API sorted. Once both teams had finished, we were then able to link the two sides by making the original hard coded data live. This led to a combination of efforts on both teams. Nearer the end of the project, specific roles organically dissolved into a joint team effort for the final touches.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While initially using a gant chat to plan our progress as seen below, we found that the time schedule didn't go acording to plan and the constant changes to the timeline led us to developing a more dynamic approach using the agile scrum format. Instead of a strict timeline/specification we held regular meetings both in the morning and evening. Morning meetings consisted of allocating roles and discussing what each member was aiming to accomplish for the day. In the evening, we would then discuss progress, allowing us to be dynamic with role allocations for the next morning and handle any merge conflicts. The combination of both of these helped in identifying problems as they came up and addressed any issues individuals had as a group, whether personal or academic.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some team members were able to meet in each other student houses to work more collaboratively, switching to Merchant Ventures Building when it because available. We found that being able to program and work together physically made us far more productive and efficient. That is not to say that we found working remotely challenging as we made regular use of Microsoft Teams which we are all familar with through our use in other modules. However, working in the same space made it was easier to help debug each other's code which led to faster turn arounds after mistakes. When working remotely, it worked well in that 
we were all free at the same times throughout the day, allowing us to easily organise meetings and jump on calls quickly if we needed an urgent issue sorting.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at ways of working, we found the one most suitable for us was the agile scrum approach, as described in the image above. Reading this image from left to right, we first look at the product backlog, which consisted of using making a list of key deliverables for our project. This is the point where we narrowed down our scope and tried to pick the most key objectives. Looking at sprint planning, we attempted to achieve this through having meetings that ranged in time and what needed to be discussed, meaning we were always flexible. The sprint backlog was a list of tasks that we needed to deliver for each sprint, where the scrum team and scrum master were the same group since we wanted everyone to feel included and contribute ideas. We would have bi-daily stand-up meetings as metioned in the previous paragraphs. We tried to complete a sprint review whenever major changes were made, however it was mainly between the team, due to the difficulty of getting stakeholders involved constantly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main benefits of using this method was that people were efficient in completing the tasks because they knew the specifics of what they had to complete. We think that the key benefit was that this method allowed us to make a start on our minimum viable product, overcoming the struggles of deciding where to start.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In future projects, we think it would be useful to include a scrum board using software such as Jira to track project status, as it could also be used as a reminder of what needs to be done next.</p>
