<h2 align="center"> <b> Initial Ideas </b> </h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our first ideation process consisted of using a Matrix which consisted of specific and rather playful themes to trigger creative solutions.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/9wmGSbz/Screenshot-2021-05-06-at-12-28-47.jpg" alt="Screenshot-2021-05-06-at-12-28-47" border="0"></p>

 
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of all the themes and their playful variations, as a group, we showed a particular interest in the following areas:</p>

- Tinder for finding housemates – matching groups to individuals. 
- Finding movie to watch using virtual dartboard (movie recommender based on preferences).
- Find someone to eat dinner with online – sort of like tinder, one meal at a time. 
- Trip advisor but for care homes.

 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our initial methodology of narrowing down to our potential project was to judge the ideas on the basis of individual interest and excitement towards them. There was a clear consensus that 1. The tinder for finding housemates idea and 2. The Finding a movie to watch using a virtual dartboard; were the two favourites.</p>

 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Narrowing down to 2 potential projects, we now considered a different approach to choosing our project; one that relies on expected complexity, feasibility and how big of a problem it solves. Ultimately, after exploring the logistics and requirements of building some kind of graphical interface that would mimic a dartboard, we mutually agreed that it was simply too hard to achieve. We then looked into identifying the complexities and feasibility of making a tinder for housemates’ web app and our research gave us confidence that this is the project we will pursue.</p>

 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important factors that give us confidence in this project is the fact that it solves a real problem, it involves a good balance between backend and frontend requirements, and we all agree that it will be a huge learning experience for us all.</p>

<h2 align="center">Design Process</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The design process began shortly after the project proposal had been confirmed. Several members of the team had drafted on paper their design and layout ideas, and then we collated our ideas onto our first paper prototype model which is shown below, we found paper prototyping made it easy to visualise our own individual ideas, but due to remotely working on Microsoft Teams and Discord, it was initially difficult to bring these ideas together into one definitive paper prototype. To solve this problem the team decided in late February to use a collaborative interface design tool such as Figma. This made the design process much smoother and allowed the team to all be on the same page. Since then all developers could interact with the same Figma sketch simultaneously, combining drafted paper prototype ideas to create one, singular wireframe prototype.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original wireframe prototype has significant differences in design from the final product. This is mainly due to our decision to base the final design off of an Angular template, but also a result of the front end team discovering which elements of the design could realistically be implemented in the real-life code. Despite these design changes, the functionality of the application has for the most part remained consistent since the start of the project and an updated wireframe was later created as a reference for front end code development and a means to acquire user feedback information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the decision to use a tempalte we decided to construct another paper prototype to visualise the new design of the application given the new templates and components we could use through the Argon template we downloaded. This paper prototype is shown below. Once this paper prototype design had been confirmed as our final design we translated into onto a wireframe model shown in the ----- section.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed in the 'Front End' section of the documentation, the decision to use a template from the Argon website (https://demos.creative-tim.com/argon-design-system-angular) came in early March, when the team decided it would save time wasted on making the site look 'aesthetically pleasing, and so instead of trying to code an Angular project from scratch, the team integrated the template files and began to build classes and components within that. This was initially confusing trying to work out the function of every file within the template, but after many hours of scanning through the project the pieces began to come into place and the team were able to begin implementing desired features within the HTML, stylesheet and typescript files of the template. Many ideas of what the site would look like evolved other the course of the coding as expectations were managed with the reality of the teams' limited software development skills/experience and the relatively short timeframe in which we had to complete this project. An example of this was removing the option to upload and view more than one display picture due to complications arising in both front and back end development.</p>
