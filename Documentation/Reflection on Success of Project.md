<h1 align="center">Reflection on the Success of the Project</h1>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting on the project we believe we have fulfilled the criteria of 'serious play' by solving the problem of housemate finding using a fun and interactive method of searching through profiles. We wanted to create a project that would be useful to a user rather than a project where a problem is illustrated through a playful lens but doesn't do anything pragmatic for the user.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The playful aspect of our project is the 'swiping' element of the matching page. Here the user can either like/dislike another user and visually experience the user's card fade off either to the left or right through the use of animation. Whether a match has been made their profile will move the matches page, which we think is a fun element as it incorporates the dynamics of dating apps, and changes up the usually mundane scroll through housemates profiles on sites such as Spareroom.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were ambitious at the beginning of the project and we could say we may have got carried away with some ideas that, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but we reached a point with some features that we would not be able to implement given our limited technical ability. Given this, we are still very proud of the project we have built and it still serves the same purpose as intended in easing and making the search for housemates more fun, so we believe the end-product has been a success. Given more time we would have implemented more advanced features such as an option to chat with other users on the app etc. We have explored the idea that this may be a viable product that could be brought to market.  Potentially we could work on our HouseHomies post-university to add more features and make the project ready for deployement nto the real world. We look forward in seeing where we can take it.</p>
