<h1 align="center">Reflection on the Success of the Project</h1>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting on the project we believe we have fulfilled the criteria of 'serious play' by solving the problem of housemate finding using a fun and interactive method of searching through profiles. We wanted to create a project that would be useful to a user rather than a project where a problem is illustrated through a playful lens but doesn't do anything pragmatic for the user.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The playful aspect of our project is the 'swiping' element of the matching page. Here the user can either like/dislike another user and visually experience the user's card fade off either to the left or right through the use of animation. Whether a match has been made their profile will move the matches page, which we think is a fun element as it incorporates the dynamics of dating apps, and changes up the usually mundane scroll through housemates profiles on sites such as Spareroom.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were ambitious at the beginning of the project and we could say we may have got carried away with some ideas, while not necessarily a bad thing, unfortunately we reached a point with some features that we would not be able to implement given our limited technical ability and timeframe. Given this, we are still very proud of the project we have built and it still serves the same purpose as intended in easing and making the search for housemates more fun, so we believe the end-product has been a success. Given more time we would have implemented more advanced features such as an option to chat with other users on the app etc. We have explored the idea that this may be a viable product that could be brought to market. Potentially we could work on our HouseHomies post-university to add more features and make the project ready for deployement nto the real world. We look forward in seeing where we can take it.</p>

<h1 align="center">Reflecting on project objectives:</h1>

<h4 align="left">Create a single page web app for students, aiding in their search for housemates, using mechanics similar to those seen in dating apps such as Tinder:</h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned above, we feel as though we clearly met this objective as we interpreted it. Creating the sliding animation on a like or dislike. However, it may also have been interpreted as allowing for the user to use their mouse for swiping as similar to mobile dating apps. This is something that we would implement in a mobile version of the app but on the web version we felt it was more intuitive to simply have buttons but retain the animations.</p>

<h4 align="left">Ensure relevant information is presented in a structured format, allowing users to make more informed decisions on candidate housemates:</h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting on this objective, our app has compulsory fields for required information that users must provide on registration. This information is then shown on our card components when a profile appears on a users stack. While we are missing some fields that we discussed as being important, such as smoking households we feel that for the most part this objective has been met. Each user's information will be displayed on their profile card when appearing in another user's stack. As such the majority of key information for making informed decisions on housemates is still present, with a bio available for any extra information a user considers in their decisions.</p>

<h4 align="left">Reduce conflict and improve cohabiting relations. With hopes of enriching the university experience while also providing a strong and readily available support network during the current student mental health crisis:</h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This objective is very difficult to evaluate. We hypothesise that this will be the case as users can make more informed decisions, however it is impossible for us to say whether we can accept this hypothesis or not without large scale testing over a long time period.</p>

<h4 align="left">Bring more engagement and efficiency in the arduous task of finding flatmates through the use of gamification:</h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This objective is very similar to the first mentioned using mechanics similar to those seen in dating apps. We know that these apps are engaging due to their great success in the market. From our user feedback it also appears that we have met this as many users said our app was easy to use and commented on the visuals that go along with the mechanics, a good sign for engagement. We believe we have also improved on efficiency over previous ways to find housemates as users cannot be skipped and all relevant information is presented. When reflecting on this objective we therefore believe that we have met our goal.<p>
