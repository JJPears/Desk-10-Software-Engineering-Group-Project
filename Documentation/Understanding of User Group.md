<h2 align="center">Wireframe Testing</h2>

<p><b>Here are few cases of where we able to test our paper prototype and wireframe.</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our testing process was to arrange zoom calls and discuss how the wireframe would work. Due to various situations, we decided to meet with people we were living with or arrange zoom calls to present a working wireframe. For people we saw in person we were able to just hand over our laptops and allow them to use the app in whatever way they saw fit. For zoom calls, we shared screens and were able to give the users control of the mouse meaning they were able to, again allowing users to use the app in whatever way they saw fit. After users had the opportunity of using the app, we then asked for feedback on what they thought worked well and not so well.</p>

<h3 align="center">Overview of Test Cases:</h3>

<h3 align="center">User 1 – Current Student (Potential user)</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This user is currently living in private accommodation. Their flatmate (user 2) has recently dropped out. This user is a good person to use for testing since it shows the perspective of trying to find a new flatmate for their current flat.</p>

<h4>Positives</h4>

- The concept is a good idea, since it solves the current problem, I am in.
- I also like the fact it tries to match the current flat to a potential new flatmate as this would provide a good flat atmosphere.
- I like the tinder styling; it is very easy to use.

<h4>Potential Issues/Improvements</h4>

- Maybe try and allow users to add their social media pages to their profile. Can provide a useful resource.
- Superlike function – Would be quite useful if you were in quite a rush.
- Maybe allow for more than one photo if that is already not an option?
- What have we done to address this?
- We have suggested users to add some social media information in their bio.

<h4>What have we done to address this?</h4>

- We have made it more clear in our wireframe that more than one picture is permitted within the profile

<h3 align="center">User 2 – Recently decided to leave Uni (Potential user)</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This user has decided to leave midway through University for personal reasons. They are currently still paying for their accommodation as they are finding it quite hard to let it out to someone. This user lives with user 1. For similar reasons to user 1, they are a good person to use for testing.</p>

<h4>Positives</h4>

- Currently, what I am doing is trying to sell it on various Facebook pages which I think is quite inefficient. This resolves the issue.
- It is a good idea that I can try and get my flatmates a suitable person to live with in hope that the flat dynamic is not ruined.
- I like the map, as this means we can easily see how far the University is or whether it looks to be a good area.

<h4>Potential Issues/Improvements</h4>

<p>Would be quite useful to put in a section for situations like myself, where I want to advertise the group too and that I am selling as then I can directly sort out the details regarding the tenancy etc.</p>

- Could be slightly more aesthetically pleasing on the home page and login/register pages.
- Improved security credentials?

<h4>What have we done to address this?</h4>
- We think that the app can be used by a user in this situation.
- Tried to redesign the home/login/register pages to be more aesthetically pleasing.
- Clearly addressed that we will be using hashing to ensure that details remain secure.

<h3 align="center">User 3 – Young Professional (Potential user)</h3>

This user had used SpareRoom to find his current living situation, so was ideal in seeing how an app like this would make the experience better for him and his flatmates.

<h4>Positives</h4>

- This is a lot more fun than using SpareRoom to find a living situation.
- I think if I had used this app, I would have found a more suited household. In a pandemic, where we have spent lots of time indoors it would have been nice if we had more common ground.
- I like the material design. Very simple and easy to use.

<h4>Potential Issues/Improvements</h4>

- Would quite like an instant message service built-in, since then I don’t have to exchange contact details for every match I would get.
- A mobile app based on this would be a good idea in the future.
- Some more options in the profile might be a good idea for example relationship status and whether they would be visiting often etc.

<h4>What have we done to address this?</h4>

- We have decided to try and implement an instant message service using the Telegram API. Unsure on how complex that will be at the current stage of development.
- We would like both a mobile app and web page in a perfect world
- Tried to include more details within the profile, however visiting often can be difficult to add.

We have designed an interaction flow diagram using Figma, ensuring that we remain consistent with the wireframe we have also produced.

<h2 align="center">Analysis of Survey Feedback</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short survey was created and distributed to various potential users as a means to understand more about their current opinion on the concept of a House share finding platform, as well as gain some feedback on what they considered to be important factors when finding a housemate, and some design tips.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, a total of 18 users completed this short questionnaire regarding our web application idea. The results mostly conclude that the platform would be used by members of society and help to solve a real-world issue.</p>

<h2 align="center">Question 1</h2>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74371711/116882465-62b4a600-ac1c-11eb-88c8-a13f2768eead.png)

- When asked which platform people would currently use if in need of finding housemates, 100% of users selected social media. This strongly indicates that there is currently a gap in the market for a functional or popular house share finding application.
- One user selected both Social Media and Website/Application, suggesting they would be inclined to use both platforms. Our aim is to make our platform more engaging and easier to use than house share pages on social media.

<h2 align="center">Question 2</h2>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74371711/116882613-90015400-ac1c-11eb-9902-b1a5b6a8165c.png)

- This question was interpreted incorrectly by 4 users, as it was only supposed to be answered by users who selected Website/Application.
- The person who selected Website/Application suggested that they would use a platform called Spare Room. This platform will be reviewed by the group and the positive and negative aspects of its features and user interface considered in order to improve our own housemate finding platform.


<h2 align="center">Question 3</h2>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74371711/116882696-a60f1480-ac1c-11eb-9bd6-447a7af96455.png)

- When asked which platform users would prefer to use in the future, 61.1% of users opted for an Application. This is a fairly strong indication that our web application would be a popular platform for those in need of finding a housemate and thus most likely be a viable alternative to the current social media monopoly on housemate finding.

<h2 align="center">Question 4</h2>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74371711/116882746-b4f5c700-ac1c-11eb-85c9-3d3bedaf85b1.png)

- 27.8% of users said that Gender was one of the most important factors to consider when finding a housemate. This figure is lower than the group expected and therefore we may decide to put less significance on the matching of genders on our platform.

- 88.9% of users said that Age was an important factor when finding a housemate. This figure is very high and so is definitely something that should be a significant factor included in our matching algorithm. 

- 50% of users said Budget was an important factor. This suggests it is definitely a relevant criterion to include but may be tricky to implement into the matching algorithm without the use of budget constraint values. Therefore, the group may decide to offer several budget constraint options in the profile setup, which can be selected by the user.

- 94.4% of users said that Lifestyle was one of the most important factors. In fact, this was voted as generally the most popular criteria for finding a housemate, with only one person not selecting it. This feedback strongly suggests that lifestyle choices should be included in profile setup and either displayed on users’ bio pages or included in the matching algorithm if possible.

- 0% of users said that University Course was an important factor whilst choosing a housemate. This figure is much lower than expected seeing as the group has now decided the web app will be targeted at Bristol students. Perhaps we will make this field optional in the profile setup. 

- 55% of users said that Interests and Hobbies was an important factor. This is similar to lifestyle, but since hobbies may vary significantly, we will probably just display these on the user’s bio page so that other users can view them.

- 0% of users said that Religion was an important factor. Based on this feedback we may decide as a group to completely scrap this criterion from the options, or at least make it an optional field.

<h4 align="center">Evaluation of Criteria Feedback</h4>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feedback on matching criteria has definitely provided useful information for deciding which factors are most significant for the matching of different users. However, it is important to consider the demographic of the people the survey was distributed to. Since most of the people who filled out this form were friends of our age who have graduated from university, it is natural that they would no longer consider options such as University Course to be of importance. Furthermore, these users are mostly all of the same age and from similar backgrounds. Perhaps for some more robust feedback and data the survey would need to be distributed to different demographics of students, such as first years and groups in sixth form. Results may vary significantly depending on the target audience.</p>

<h2 align="center">Question 5</h2>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74371711/116883023-0736e800-ac1d-11eb-8f60-1d85ba89d3c6.png)

- This question was not particularly helpful. It only received two responses, both of which were already listed in the previous question. However, it does suggest that we have already considered most of the important criteria for finding a housemate in the previous question.

<h2 align="center">Question 6</h2>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74371711/116883128-29c90100-ac1d-11eb-95bc-770a7dcb336d.png)

- 72.2% of users said that they preferred the swiping animation such as on an app like Tinder, rather than a like and dislike button similar to the dating app Hinge. This may be a technical challenge as our application is a website rather than a mobile app. 
- However, as the groups JavaScript skills improve over the unit, we may be able to implement some kind of animations when the like and dislike buttons are clicked on.

<h2 align="center">Question 7</h2>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74371711/116883242-49602980-ac1d-11eb-8d78-70af0c8b0e17.png)

- When asked if users would recommend a Tinder like housemate finding application to a friend in need of a housemate in the future, the results were very promising.
- With 55.6% of users saying they would Absolutely recommend this platform to a friend in need and 44.4% saying they would be Very Likely to, this indicated that our idea would be a popular choice for users and would be solving a real-life problem.
- However, as previously discussed, this survey was completed by a limited demographic of people that the group know personally. Therefore, these users may be more inclined to give biased positive feedback. In the future it would be good to get feedback from a wider demographic to provide more conclusive data, but that has been challenging currently due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
