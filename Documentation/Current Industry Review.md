<h2 align="center"> <b> Clifton Stoke Bishop Tickets </b> </h2>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the majority of University of Bristol students use the 'Clifton Stoke Bishop Tickets' Facebook page to post/look for spare rooms or other students to live with. This could be considered an effective way of finding potential housemates as the majority of students follow/like that page, however, that page is not primarily for student accommodation. It is used primarily for selling event tickets, lost and found items and also businesses advertising. This means it is a tedious process in finding housing posts and some of which are illegible as some people have specific requirements when it comes to housing. Also with these Facebook advertisements, it is one party that explicitly reaches out to the advertiser. This sort of communication method may discourage people from reaching out to others in fear of rejection. Our application solves this problem as you can only communicate with the other party if both parties have 'liked' the other 
user, preventing the embarassment of rejection.</p>
  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our application aims to make the process of finding housemates as streamlined as possible, and avoid all the inefficiencies that occur in finding housemate through Facebook.</p>

<h2 align="center"> <b> Bristol Uni Housemate Finder </b> </h2>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alongside Clifton Stoke Bishop Tickets, there is a large amount of activity on University of Bristol Housemate Finder. This is a closed Facebook group that targets Bristol University students. Currently there are two options for displaying interest in forming groups, the first is the discussion section where Facebook users can make posts, however these are all moderated by an admin which from personal experience don't seem to be particularly active, leading to delays on posts. The second method is to enter your details into a form that is submitted to a dashboard for others to browse.
</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bristol Uni Housemate Finder provides the most specialised service, targeted for University of Bristol students. It also contains features we found to be very desirable such as filters and options to display if you are a group or individual. However, many people still resort to the discussion where information is often limited and profiles can easily be missed. We hope the playful swiping element will help to solve these issues and create a singular more engaging option for our users.

<h2 align="center"> <b> Spareroom </b> </h2>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spareroom is another major provider in finding housemates or a spare room. Spareroom caters for both students and the general public, and it includes many factors which help in finding suitable housemates/spare room, such as smoking household, occupation and living with landlord etc. 
One of the aspects of Spareroom that we like is that you are able to set a profile picture, a bio and you can also list options you're looking for. This is an improvement on the Facebook posts which usually only detail the room and price.</p>

<h2 align="center"> <b> Badi </b> </h2>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Badi is another application that facilitates finding housemates or a spare room. The aesthetics of the badi site is very appealing and we found that they offer many options in finding specific rooms/people that suit your personal taste such as:</p>

- <p>Each property that is listed by the user has details on availability, current flatmates, preferred flatmates details, size, include amenities and a map. It also shows suggestions, linking to similar rooms</p>
- <p>Preferred flatmate option that includes gender, age, occupation</p>
- Pictures of the flats with a user who has a score that is based on things like verified data, including bank and personal details

<p>Badi was similar to spareroom, but both failed to make the process of finding a housemate fun, which we aim to deliver in our project.

<h2 align="center"> <b> Tinder </b> </h2>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the platforms we looked through, none provide a playful aspect in finding housemates or a spare room. Therefore, we looked to successful apps such as Tinder for inspiration, hoping to make housemate finding a more fun experience. Having looked at Tinder we found it easy to navigate with minimal tabs making it user friendly, easy to get started and we found the swiping aspect more fun than just scrolling. We found due to the swiping mechanic every user is guaranteed to be displayed eventually, there is no chance of scrolling/swiping past any suitable housemates.
